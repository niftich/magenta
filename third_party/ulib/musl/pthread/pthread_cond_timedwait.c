/*
 * struct waiter
 *
 * Waiter objects have automatic storage on the waiting thread, and
 * are used in building a linked list representing waiters currently
 * waiting on the condition variable or a group of waiters woken
 * together by a broadcast or signal; in the case of signal, this is a
 * degenerate list of one member.
 *
 * Waiter lists attached to the condition variable itself are
 * protected by the lock on the cv. Detached waiter lists are never
 * modified again, but can only be traversed in reverse order, and are
 * protected by the "barrier" locks in each node, which are unlocked
 * in turn to control wake order.
