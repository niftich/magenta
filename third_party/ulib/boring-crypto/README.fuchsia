License: ISC

BoringSSL inherits a complicated licensing story from its predecessor.
This is a subset of BoringSSL, taking the following files:
 - crypto/chacha/chacha.c (ISC license)
 - crypto/chacha/chacha_test.cc (ISC license)
 - include/openssl/chacha.h (ISC license)

This subset MUST match a single revision of BoringSSL.  In other words,
updating any file requires all files to be updated to the matching revision.

Modifications:
 - Changed header guard to '#pragma once'
 - Added __BEGIN/END_CDECLs
 - Removed OPENSSL_EXPORT and changed OPENSSL_memcpy to memcpy
 - Replaced inclusion of BoringSSL headers
 - Explicitly disabled ASM version.
 - Replaced 'buffer_alias' assertion with equivalent to remove "../internal.h"
 - Renamed chacha_test.cc to chacha_unittest.cpp
 - Wired chacha_unittest.cpp into kernel unittest system
