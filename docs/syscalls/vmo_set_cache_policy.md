# mx_vmo_op_range

## NAME

vmo_set_cache_policy - set the caching policy for pages held by a VMO.

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <magenta/syscalls.h>

mx_status_t vmo_set_cache_policy(mx_handle_t handle, uint32_t cache_policy);

```

## DESCRIPTION

**vmo_set_cache_policy()** sets caching policy for a VMO holding physical
memory. Such VMOs are generally only handed to userspace via bus protocol
interfaces, so this syscall will typically only be used by drivers dealing with
device memory. A handle must have the *MX_RIGHT_MAP* right for this call to be
permitted. Additionally, the VMO must not presently be mapped by any process,
and the cache policy must not have been set prior to this call.

*cache_policy* cache flags to use:

**MX_CACHE_POLICY_CACHED** - Use hardware caching.

**MX_CACHE_POLICY_UNCACHED** - Disable caching.

**MX_CACHE_POLICY_UNCACHED_DEVICE** - Disable cache and treat as device memory.
This is architecture dependent and may be equivalent to
*MX_CACHE_POLICY_UNCACHED* on some architectures.

**MX_CACHE_POLICY_WRITE_COMBINING** - Use write combining. This is architecture
dependent and may be equivalent to *MX_CACHE_POLICY_UNCACHED*.

## RETURN VALUE

**vmo_set_cache_policy()** returns **NO_ERROR** on success. In the event of
failure, a negative error value is returned.

## ERRORS

**ERR_ACCESS_DENIED** Cache policy has been configured for this VMO already and
may not be changed, or *handle* lacks the MX_RIGHT_MAP right.

**ERR_BAD_HANDLE** *handle* is not a valid handle.

**ERR_INVALID_ARGS** *cache_policy* contains flags outside of the ones listed
above, or *cache_policy* contains an invalid mix of cache policy flags.

**ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED** The VMO *handle* corresponds to is not one holding
physical memory.

**ERR_BAD_STATE** Cache policy cannot be changed because the VMO is presently
mapped.
