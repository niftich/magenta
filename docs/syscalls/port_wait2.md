# mx_port_wait  (v2)

## NAME

port_wait - wait for a packet arrival in a port, version 2.

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <magenta/syscalls.h>
#include <magenta/syscalls/port.h>

mx_status_t mx_port_wait(mx_handle_t handle, mx_time_t deadline, void* packet, size_t size);
```

## DESCRIPTION

**port_wait**() is a blocking syscall which causes the caller to wait until at least
one packet is available. See [here](port_wait.md) for version 1.

Upon return, if successful *packet* will contain the earliest (in FIFO order)
available packet data.

The **size** argument should be set to zero and the **packet** argument should be memory of at
least ```sizeof(mx_port_packet_t)``` bytes.

The *deadline* indicates when to stop waiting for a packet (with respect to
**MX_CLOCK_MONOTONIC**).  If no packet has arrived by the deadline,
**ERR_TIMED_OUT** is returned.  The value **MX_TIME_INFINITE** will
result in waiting forever.  A value in the past will result in an immediate
timeout, unless a packet is already available for reading.

Unlike **mx_wait_one**() and **mx_wait_many**() only one waiting thread is
released (per available packet) which makes ports amenable to be serviced
by thread pools.

There are two sources of packets: manually queued packets with **port_queue**() and packets
generated by kernel when objects registered with **object_wait_async**() change state. In both
cases the packet is always of type **mx_port_packet_t**:

```
struct mx_port_packet_t {
    uint64_t key;
    uint32_t type;
    int32_t status;
    union {
        mx_packet_user_t user;
        mx_packet_signal_t signal;
    };
};
```

In the case of packets generated via **port_queue**() *key* is the key in the
input packet, *type* is set to **MX_PKT_TYPE_USER** and the union is of type **mx_packet_user_t**.

```
typedef union mx_packet_user {
    uint64_t u64[4];
    uint32_t u32[8];
    uint16_t u16[16];
    uint8_t   c8[32];
} mx_packet_user_t;
```

The caller of **port_queue**() controls all the values in the structure.

In the case of packets generated via **object_wait_async**() *key* is the key passed to the
syscall, *type* is set to either **MX_PKT_TYPE_SIGNAL_ONE** or **MX_PKT_TYPE_SIGNAL_REP**
and the union is of type **mx_packet_signal_t**:

```
typedef struct mx_packet_signal {
    mx_signals_t trigger;
    mx_signals_t observed;
    uint64_t count;
} mx_packet_signal_t;
```

for **MX_WAIT_ASYNC_ONCE** and **MX_WAIT_ASYNC_REPEATING**: *trigger* is the signals
used in the call to **object_wait_async**() and *count* is a per object defined count
of pending operations. Use *key* to track what object this packet corresponds to and
therefore match *count* with the operation.

See [object_wait_async](object_wait_async.md) for more details.

## RETURN VALUE

**port_wait**() returns **NO_ERROR** on successful packet dequeuing .

## ERRORS

**ERR_BAD_HANDLE** *handle* is not a valid handle.

**ERR_INVALID_ARGS** *handle* isn't a valid handle or *packet* isn't a valid
pointer or *size* is an invalid packet size.

**ERR_ACCESS_DENIED** *handle* does not have **MX_RIGHT_WRITE** and may
not be waited upon.

**ERR_TIMED_OUT** *deadline* passed and no packet was available.
