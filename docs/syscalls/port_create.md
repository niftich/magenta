# mx_port_create

## NAME

port_create - create an IO port

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <magenta/syscalls.h>

mx_status_t mx_port_create(uint32_t options, mx_handle_t* out);

```

## DESCRIPTION

**port_create**() creates an port; a waitable object that can be used to
read packets queued by kernel or by user-mode.

*options* can be 0 to create a port version 1 or **MX_PORT_OPT_V2** to
create a port version 2. The two versions have different behavior with respect
to the operations as summarized in the notes below.

The returned handle will have MX_RIGHT_TRANSFER (allowing them to be sent
to another process via channel write), MX_RIGHT_WRITE (allowing
packets to be queued), MX_RIGHT_READ (allowing packets to be read) and
MX_RIGHT_DUPLICATE (allowing them to be duplicated).

## RETURN VALUE

**port_create**() returns NO_ERROR and a valid IO port handle via *out* on
success. In the event of failure, an error value is returned.

## ERRORS

**ERR_INVALID_ARGS** *options* has an invalid value, or *out* is an
invalid pointer or NULL.

**ERR_NO_MEMORY**  (Temporary) Failure due to lack of memory.

## NOTES
Differences between ports version 1 and version 2:
+ port_queue : applies to both
+ port_wait  : applies to both
+ port_bind  : applies to port version 1
+ object_wait_async : applies to port version 2
