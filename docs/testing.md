# Testing

The test harness which runs on our bots (called "runtests") picks up all
executables in the "/boot/test" and "/system/test" directories and runs them.
If you provide a command-line argument, such as `runtests -S -m widget_test`,
runtests will only run the single test requested -- in this case, `widget_test`.

"runtests" takes command-line arguments to toggle classes of tests to execute.

These classes are the following:

* **Small**: Isolated tests for functions and classes. These must be totally
  synchronous and single-threaded. These tests should be parallelizable; there
  shouldn't be any shared resources between them.
* **Medium**: Single-process integration tests. Ideally these are also synchronous
  and single-threaded but they might run through a large chunk of code in each
  test case, or they might use disk, making them a bit slower.
* **Large**: Slow, multi-process, or particularly incomprehensible single-process
  integration tests. These tests are often too slow / flaky to run in a CQ, and
  we should try to limit how many we have.
* **Performance**: Tests which are expected to pass, but which are measured
  using other metrics (thresholds, statistical techniques) to identify
  regressions.

Since runtests doesn't really know what "class" is executing when it launches a
test, it encodes this information in the environment variable
`RUNTESTS_TEST_CLASS`, which is detailed in [the unittest
header][unittest-header] , and lets the executable itself decide what to run /
not run. This environment variable is a bitmask indicating which tests to run.

For example, if a a test executable is run with "small" and "medium" tests,
it will be executed ONCE with `RUNTESTS_TEST_CLASS` set to 00000003 (the
hex bitwise OR of "TEST_SMALL" and "TEST_MEDIUM" -- though this information
should be parsed using the [unittest header][unittest-header], as it may be
updated in the future).

## Magenta Tests (ulib/test, and/or using ulib/unittest)

The following macros can be used to filter tests into these categories:
```
RUN_TEST_SMALL(widget_tiny_test)
RUN_TEST_MEDIUM(widget_test)
RUN_TEST_LARGE(widget_big_test)
RUN_TEST_PERFORMANCE(widget_benchmark)
```

The legacy `RUN_TEST(widget_test)` is aliased to mean the same thing as
`RUN_TEST_SMALL`.

## Fuchsia Tests (not using ulib/unittest)

The environment variable `RUNTESTS_TEST_CLASS` will still be available to all
executables launched by runtests. The [unittest header][unittest-header] can be
used to parse different categories of tests which the runtests harness attempted
to run.

## Runtests CLI

By default, runtests will run both small and medium tests.

To determine how to run a custom set of test categories, run `runtests -h`,
which includes usage information.
