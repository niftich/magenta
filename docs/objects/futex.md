# Futex

## NAME

futex - A primitive for creating userspace synchronization tools.

## SYNOPSIS

A **futex** is a Fast Userspace muTEX. It is a low level
synchronization primitive which is a building block for higher level
APIs such as `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_cond_t`.

Futexes are designed to not enter the kernel or allocate kernel
resources in the uncontested case.

## DESCRIPTION

The magenta futex implementation currently supports three operations:

```C
    mx_status_t mx_futex_wait(mx_futex_t* value_ptr, int current_value,
                              mx_time_t timeout);
    mx_status_t mx_futex_wake(mx_futex_t* value_ptr, uint32_t wake_count);
    mx_status_t mx_futex_requeue(mx_futex_t* value_ptr, uint32_t wake_count,
                                 int current_value, mx_futex_t* requeue_ptr,
                                 uint32_t requeue_count);
```

All of these share a `value_ptr` parameter, which is the virtual
address of an aligned userspace integer. This virtual address is the
information used in kernel to track what futex given threads are
waiting on. The kernel does not currently modify the value of
`*value_ptr` (but see below for future operations which might do
so). It is up to userspace code to correctly atomically modify this
value across threads in order to build mutexes and so on.

See the [futex_wait](../syscalls/futex_wait.md),
[futex_wake](../syscalls/futex_wake.md), and
[futex_requeue](../syscalls/futex_requeue.md) man pages for more details.

### Differences from Linux futexes

Note that all of the magenta futex operations key off of the virtual
address of an userspace pointer. This differs from the Linux
implementation, which distinguishes private futex operations (which
correspond to our in-process-only ones) from ones shared across
address spaces.

As noted above, all of our futex operations leave the value of the
futex unmodified from the kernel. Other potential operations, such as
Linux's `FUTEX_WAKE_OP`, requires atomic manipulation of the value
from the kernel, which our current implementation does not require.

- [Fuss, Futexes and Furwocks: Fast Userlevel Locking in Linux](https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2002/ols2002-pages-479-495.pdf), Hubertus Franke and Rusty Russell

    This is the original white paper describing the Linux futex. It
    documents the history and design of the original implementation,
    prior (failed) attempts at creating a fast userspace
    synchronization primitive, and performance measurements.

- [Futexes Are Tricky](https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/futex.pdf), Ulrich Drepper

    This paper describes some gotchas and implementation details of
    futexes in Linux. It discusses the kernel implementation, and goes
    into more detail about correct and efficient userspace
    implementations of mutexes, condition variables, and so on.

- [Mutexes and Condition Variables using Futexes](http://locklessinc.com/articles/mutex_cv_futex/)

    Further commentary on "Futexes are tricky", outlining a simple
    implementation that avoids the need for `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE`

- [Locking in WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/), Filip Pizlo

    An in-depth tour of the locking primitives in WebKit, complete with
    benchmarks and analysis. Contains a detailed explanation of the "parking
    lot" concept, which allows very compact representation of user-space
    mutexes.
