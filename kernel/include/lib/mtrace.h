// N.B. This is ideally temporary. It is used by Intel PT support, and is a
// stopgap until "resources" can be used to read/write x86 MSRs.
// "mtrace" == "magenta trace": the idea being to be a generalization of
// ktrace. It's all temporary, but there may be other uses before the stopgap
// is no longer necessary.
