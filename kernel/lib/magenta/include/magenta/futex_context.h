// FutexContext is a class that encapsulates support for futex operations.
// FutexContext uses a hash table keyed on the futex address (a pointer to integer in userspace)
// to contain all active futexes.
// A futex is considered active if there is one or more threads blocked on the futex.
// After no threads are left blocked on a futex it is removed from the hash table.
// The value in the futex hash table is the FutexNode object associated with the head
// of the list of threads blocked on the futex.
// To avoid memory allocation at futex operation time, a FutexNode is embedded in each
// UserThread object.
// When the thread at the head of the futex's blocked thread list is resumed,
// The FutexNode for the new head of the blocked thread list is set as the hash table value
// for the futex.
