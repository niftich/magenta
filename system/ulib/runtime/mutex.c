// This mutex implementation is based on Ulrich Drepper's paper "Futexes
// Are Tricky" (dated November 5, 2011; see
// http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/futex.pdf).  We use the approach from
// "Mutex, Take 2", with one modification: We use an atomic swap in
// mxr_mutex_unlock() rather than an atomic decrement.

// The value of UNLOCKED must be 0 to match mutex.h and so that mutexes can
// be allocated in BSS segments (zero-initialized data).
