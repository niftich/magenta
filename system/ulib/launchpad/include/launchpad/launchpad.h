// Opaque type representing launchpad state.
// Use of this object is not thread-safe.
typedef struct launchpad launchpad_t;

// API OVERVIEW
// -------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Launchpad is designed to be used like this:
//   launchpad_t* lp;
//   launchpad_create(job, "processname", &lp);
//   launchpad_load_from_file(lp, argv[0]);
//   launchpad_set_args(lp, argc, argv);
//   launchpad_set_environ(lp, env);
//   << other launchpad_*() calls to setup initial fds, handles, etc >>
//   mx_handle_t proc;
//   const char* errmsg;
//   mx_status_t status = launchpad_go(lp, &proc, &errmsg);
//   if (status < 0)
//       printf("launchpad failed: %s: %d\n", errmsg, status);
//
// If any of the calls leading up to launchpad_go(), including
// launchpad_create() itself fail, launchpad_go() will return
// an error, and (if errmsg is non-NULL) provide a human-readable
// descriptive string.
// If proc is NULL, the process handle is closed for you.
//
// There are alternative versions of launchpad_create_*() which
// provide more options, various simple and complex alternatives to
// launchpad_load_*(), and a variety of functions to configure fds,
// handles, etc, which are passed to the new process.  They are
// described in detail below.


// CREATION: one launchpad_create*() below must be called to create
// a launchpad before any other operations may be one with it.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------

// Create a new process and a launchpad that will set it up.
// The job handle is used for creation of the process, but is not
// taken ownership of or closed.
//
// If the job handle is 0 (MX_HANDLE_INVALID), the default job for
// the running process is used, if it exists (mx_job_default()).
//
// Unless the new process is provided with a job handle, at time
// of launch or later, it will not be able to create any more
// processes.
mx_status_t launchpad_create(mx_handle_t job, const char* name,
                             launchpad_t** lp);

// Create a new process and a launchpad that will set it up.
// The creation_job handle is used to create the process but is
// not taken ownership of or closed.
//
// The transfered_job handle is optional.  If non-zero, it is
// consumed by the launchpad and will be passed to the new process
// on successful launch or closed on failure.
mx_status_t launchpad_create_with_jobs(mx_handle_t creation_job,
                                       mx_handle_t transfered_job,
                                       const char* name,
                                       launchpad_t** result);

// Create a new launchpad for a given existing process handle and a
// its root VMAR handle.  On success, the launchpad takes ownership
// of both handles.
mx_status_t launchpad_create_with_process(mx_handle_t proc,
                                          mx_handle_t vmar,
                                          launchpad_t** result);


// LAUNCHING or ABORTING:
// ----------------------------------------------------------------

// If none of the launchpad_*() calls against this launchpad have failed,
// and launchpad_abort() has not been called, this will attempt to complete
// the launch of the process.
//
// This is launchpad_start() + launchpad_error_message() + launchpad_destroy()
// If proc is NULL, the process handle is closed instead of returned.
// If errmsg is non-NULL, the human readable status string is returned.
//
// The launchpad is destroyed (via launchpad_destroy()) before this returns,
// all resources are reclaimed, handles are closed, and may not be accessed
// again.
mx_status_t launchpad_go(launchpad_t* lp, mx_handle_t* proc, const char** errmsg);

// Clean up a launchpad_t, freeing all resources stored therein.
// TODO(mcgrathr): Currently this closes the process handle but does
// not kill a process that hasn't been started yet.
void launchpad_destroy(launchpad_t* lp);

// This ensures that the launchpad will not be launchable and
// any calls to launchpad_go() will fail.
// If it is not already in an error state, the error state is
// set to status, and errmsg is set to msg.
// If status is non-negative, it is interpreted as ERR_INTERNAL.
void launchpad_abort(launchpad_t* lp, mx_status_t status, const char* msg);

// If any launchpad_*() call against this lp has failed, this returns
// a human-readable detailed message describing the failure that may
// assist in debugging.
const char* launchpad_error_message(launchpad_t* lp);
mx_status_t launchpad_get_status(launchpad_t* lp);


// SIMPLIFIED BINARY LOADING
// These functions are convenience wrappers around the more powerful
// Advanced Binary Loading functions described below.  They cover the
// most common use cases.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------

// Load an ELF PIE binary from path
mx_status_t launchpad_load_from_file(launchpad_t* lp, const char* path);

// Load an ELF PIE binary from vmo
mx_status_t launchpad_load_from_vmo(launchpad_t* lp, mx_handle_t vmo);


// ADDING ARGUMENTS, ENVIRONMENT, AND HANDLES
// These functions setup arguments, environment, or handles to be
// passed to the new process via the processargs protocol.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

// Set the arguments, environment, or nametable to be passed in the
// bootstrap message.  All the strings are copied into the launchpad
// by this call, with no pointers to these argument strings retained.
// Successive calls replace the previous values.

// Add one or more handles to be passed in the bootstrap message.
// The launchpad takes ownership of the handles; they will be closed
// by launchpad_destroy or transferred by launchpad_start.
// Successive calls append more handles.  The list of handles to
// send is cleared only by a successful launchpad_start call.
// It is an error to add a handle of 0 (MX_HANDLE_INVALID)
mx_status_t launchpad_add_handle(launchpad_t* lp, mx_handle_t h, uint32_t id);

// ADDING MXIO FILE DESCRIPTORS
// These functions configure the initial file descriptors, root directory,
// and current working directory for processes which use libmxio for the
// posix-style io api (open/close/read/write/...)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------


// This function allows some or all of the environment of the
// running process to be shared with the process being launched.
// The items shared are as of the call to launchpad_clone().
//
// CLONE_MXIO_ROOT   shares the root filestem view
// CLONE_MXIO_CWD    shares the current working directory
// CLONE_MXIO_STDIO  shares file descriptors 0, 1, and 2
// CLONE_ENVIRON     shares the environment
// CLONE_JOB         shares the default job (if one exists)
//
// It is *not* an error if any of the above requested items don't
// exist (eg, fd0 is closed)
//
// launchpad_clone_fd() and launchpad_trasnfer_fd() may be used to
// add additional file descriptors to the launched process.

// ADVANCED BINARY LOADING
// These functions provide advanced control over binary loading.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------

// Map in the PT_LOAD segments of the ELF file image found in a VM
// object.  If the file has a PT_GNU_STACK program header with a
// nonzero p_memsz field, this calls launchpad_set_stack_size with
// that value.  This does not check the file for a PT_INTERP program
// header.  This consumes the VM object.
// If the 'vmo' argument is a negative error code rather
// than a handle, that result is just returned immediately; so this
// can be passed the result of <launchpad/vmo.h> functions without
// separate error checking.

// Do general loading of the ELF file image found in a VM object.
// The interface follows the same rules as launchpad_elf_load_basic.
// If the file has no PT_INTERP program header, this behaves the

// string, that string is looked up via the loader service and the
// resulting VM object is loaded instead of the handle passed here,
// which is instead transferred to the dynamic linker in the
// bootstrap message.
mx_status_t launchpad_elf_load(launchpad_t* lp, mx_handle_t vmo);

// Load an extra ELF file image into the process.  This is similar
// to launchpad_elf_load_basic, but it does not consume the VM
// object handle, does affect the state of the launchpad's
// send_loader_message flag, and does not set the entrypoint
// returned by launchpad_get_entry_address and used by
// launchpad_start.  Instead, if base is not NULL, it's filled with
// the address at which the image was loaded; if entry is not NULL,
// it's filled with the image's entrypoint address.

// will be loaded as per launchpad_elf_load. If it is a script (the
// first two characters are "#!"), the next sequence of non-whitespace
// characters in the file specify the name of an interpreter that will
// be loaded instead, using the loader service RPC. Any text that
// follows the interpreter specification on the first line will be passed
// as the first argument to the interpreter, followed by all of the
// original argv arguments (which includes the script name in argv[0]).
// The length of the first line of an interpreted script may not exceed
